                <h2>Bio</h2>
                <p>I live in Richmond, VA with my wife and three kids. After graduating from Virginia Tech with a degree in Computer Engineering, I worked in the software development field for four years. I spent the next 12 years of my life working in campus ministry; first for six years as an Associate Director at the BCM (Baptist Collegiate Ministries) at Virginia Tech, then for six years as the Director of the BCM at VCU.</p>

                <h3>Student Info Database</h3>
                <p>PHP / MySQL web application.</p>
                <p>I created this project to meet a need of the campus ministry organization I worked for. We were storing contact information about our students in a set of MS Access databases on a local office computer. We needed a better way to organize this information, plus the ability to access it from anywhere.</p>
